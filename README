This project scrapes http://barcampmilwaukee.org/joules and produces a
Flot chart http://code.google.com/p/flot/ from the data.

Progam flow:

Produce a json encoded data point from the datastore to feed the Flot 
library on the homepage.

Via cron:
scrape
determine if we've seen this statistic already
if not, add it to the datastore
